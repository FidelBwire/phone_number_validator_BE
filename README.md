This is the backend of a demo phone number verifier/validator, which basically fetches sample data, ie. phone number, owner's name, country, and status - whether the number is valid or invalid. 
It allows filtering of the data on the basis of the country registered and the validity status. 
The application can either be cloned using the 'git clone https://github.com/FidelBwire/phone_number_validator_BE.git' command then either run directly on an IDE or biult into a jar file, which can be run, or whichever other deployment. If you choose the second option then you can run the built jar file using the command 'java -jar PhoneNumberValidator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' with  the option of passing in different port number by adding '-Dserver.port=<desired-port>'. By default it runs on port 8080.
The docker image willbe made publicly available at fidelisbwire/PhoneNumberValidator, from which it can be pulled by running the 'docker pull fidelisbwire/PhoneNumberValidator:0.0.1' command.
